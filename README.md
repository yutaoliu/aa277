# Multi-UAV active thermal sensing

Like birds, gliders soar by gaining power from thermals, columns of rising air of varying sizes and strengths. 
In the absence of wind, gliders descend down a path governed by the gliding ratio $$L/D$$. 
But by exploiting the upwind present in thermals, gliders are not only able to keep afloat, but also gain height by circling in on the column of rising air. 
This practice, known as *thermaling*, is also common among large birds to conserve energy. 
But thermals are by nature not visible, and could not be remotely sensed, meaning that its information is only locally available. 
This makes it difficult for a single glider to search for thermals on its own. 
Yet each glider could monitor the relative motion of its neighbors and thus navigate towards areas of stronger upwinds. Our hypothesis is that a group of UAV gliders could reach a consensus about the optimal position, and navigate themselves to a formation that benefits most out of the thermal.
 
## Simulation setup

## Performance

### LeftOrRight
Gliders either turn left(CCW) or right(CW).

### LeftOrStraight
Gliders either turn left(CCW) or head straight.

### L/R Tracking
Gliders track the particles with single integrator dynamics with L/R control.
